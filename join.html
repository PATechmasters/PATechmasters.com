        <h1>Why You Should Join Our Club.</h1>
        <hr>

        <p>Wait. Techmasters is a club too? Nice.</p>
        <p>If you're at all into technology, you've come to the right place. Techmasters started out as an on campus tech-help student organization, having been assigned the task of installing Ethernet across campus in 1998-1999.</p>
        <p>Here's a bit I pulled off from the 2001 Techmasters website.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p><em>2001:</em>
            <br> The Techmaster organization was founded a few years back and was initially based out of the PA Computer Center. Work requests would get sent in and techmasters would simply go and fix computers. When Phillips Academy was first installing the campus wide network, the techmasters started to become independent, holding weekly meetings and organizing the work requests themselves. The Techmasters beta tested the new network with the pilot program, working with members of the Technology and Telecommunications staff. It was around this time that the techmasters proposed, with the help of Sebastian Fallert, and received the "student" server. This was (and still is) a server running Linux for use of the Techmasters. This server became the home for the Techmaster Web site, as well as the Techmaster Work Order System. This system made it simple for members of the PA community to request help from the techmasters. The system also helped organize the work orders so they could be assigned to Techmasters. After the initial testing period of the PA network, the Techmasters helped their fellow students and faculty members get on the network for the first time. Each person wishing to connect to the network would get assigned a techmaster to come set up their computer. This was before DHCP was introduced on the network. Currently, the state of the Andover network is such that any student can set up their computer on their own with the instructions given during the beginning of the school year. The Techmaster organization still exists to provide support for anyone having difficulties with their connection, or with any other computer related problem.

            Pretty cool, right? Anyway. During meetings we usually gather and talk about technology - from gadgets to computer science to game-design to whatnot.
        </p>
        <p><em>Why should I go?</em>
        </p>
        <p>Great question. You'd come for the learning, and stay because you've had just decided to major in CS or Computer Engineering. No, but seriously, Techmasters is for everyone. If you want to come and learn, you can come and learn. If you think you are pretty knowledgeable when it comes to technology, come anyway to teach your peers and to discuss modern tech with other people just like you. It's a terabyte of fun.</p>
        <p>Take the two numbers and put them together, then put .html on the end. If you have 12 and 34, for example, you're looking for 1234.html.</p>
