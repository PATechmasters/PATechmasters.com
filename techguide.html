                        Unfortunately we <strong>cannot</strong> help you with this problem. This is because Andover’s Wifi runs on a different security protocol than what most wireless printers are designed to run on, so your printer will not work wirelessly.

                    </li>
                    <li class="a">
                        For your wired printer to work, you need to have the correct drivers for the printer installed. A CD or a link with the driver should have been provided when you purchased the printer, and all you need to do is download and install the driver. If you misplaced these, try searching your printer model name online to find drivers for it.

                        If you do not have a printer, or if all of the printers you touch do not work, there is another option! While on-campus, head over to <a href = "https://printon.andover.edu">printon.andover.edu</a>, login, and select a printer to start printing. Just head over to the selected location and pick up your prints.

                    <li class="a">
                        PrintOn will only load properly if you are on Andover’s Wifi network. If it still doesn’t load, then PrintOn’s servers are probably down (This is highly unlikely though).

                    <li class="a">
                        If you are using PrintOn, the only printer that supports double sided pages is “owl-lobbymain.” On page 3, there will be an option that says “duplex.” Here you will be able to select your double-side printing choices. If you are using your own printer, open up the printing panel. It should look something like this:
                        <br>
                        <img src = "/Assets/Graphics/techguide/doublesidedprinting.png">

                        Select “Copies & Pages” and go down the dropdown to select “Layout.” There will be an option called “two-sided,” which you can change to print double sided.

                        Try going to PANet, and then logging in, and clicking the link on the top-right to go directly to Canvas. If this still doesn’t work, you will need to clear your cookies. Go to your browser history or settings, clear history, and make sure you select “cookies.” Clear it and try logging back into Canvas.

                        Try right clicking on the schedules link in PAnet and selecting "open in new incognito/private window." Enter your PA credentials in the new window that opens.
                        <br><br>
                        The other, longer-term solution is to clear your cookies. Go to your browser history or settings, clear history, and make sure you select “cookies.” Clear it, restart your browser, log into PAnet, and try opening your schedules again.
